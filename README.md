## Introduction

KET is a set of production-ready defaults and best practice tools for creating enterprise-tuned Kubernetes clusters. KET was built to make it simple for organizations who fully manage their own infrastructure to deploy and run secure, highly-available Kubernetes installations with built-in sane defaults for scalable cross-cluster networking, distributed tracing, circuit-breaking, request-level routing, cluster health-checking and much more!

KET operational tools include:

1. [`Kismatic CLI`](docs/INSTALL.md)
   * Command-line control plane and lifecycle tool for installing and configuring Kubernetes on provisioned infrastructure.
2. [`Kismatic Inspector`](cmd/kismatic-inspector/README.md)
   * Cluster health and validation utility for assuring that software and network configurations of cluster nodes are correct when installing Kubernetes.
3. [`Kuberang`](https://github.com/apprenda/kuberang)
   * Cluster build verification to ensure networking and scaling work as intended. This tool is used to smoke-test a newly built cluster.
4. [Kismatic RPM & DEB Packages](docs/PACKAGES.md)
   * Packages for installing Kubernetes and its dependencies, focused on specific roles in an HA cluster.
   * With these packages installed on a local repo, it is possible to use Kismatic to install Kubernetes on nodes that do not have access to the public internet.
5. [`Kismatic Provision`](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic-provision)
   * Quickly provision infrastructure on public clouds such as AWS and Packet. Makes building demo and development clusters a 2-step process.

# Basic Installation Instructions
Use the `kismatic install` command to work through installation of a cluster. The installer expects the underlying infrastructure to be accessible via SSH using Public Key Authentication.

The installation consists of three phases:

1. **Plan**: `kismatic install plan`
   1. The installer will ask basic questions about the intent of your cluster.
   2. The installer will produce a `kismatic-cluster.yaml` which you will edit to capture your intent.
2. **Provision**
   1. You provision your own machines
   2. You tweak your network
   3. Review the installation plan in `kismatic-cluster.yaml` and add information for each node.
3. **Install**: `kismatic install apply`
   1. The installer checks your provisioned infrastructure against your intent.
   2. If the installation plan is valid, Kismatic will build you a cluster.
   3. After installation, Kismatic performs a basic test of scaling and networking on the cluster

###Using your cluster

KET automatically configures and deploys [Kubernetes Dashboard](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ui/) in your new cluster. Open the link provided at the end of the installation in your browser to use it.

Simply use the `kismatic dashboard` command to open the dashboard

You may be prompted for credentials, use `admin` for the **User Name** and `%admin_password%` (from your `kismatic-cluster.yaml` file) for the **Password**.

The installer also generates a [kubeconfig file](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubeconfig-file/) required for [kubectl](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/), just follow the instructions provided at the end of the installation to use it.
